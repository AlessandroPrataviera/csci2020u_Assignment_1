Assignment 1 of Crawford Heidinger and Alessandro Prataveira 


Overview
---------------------------------------------------
Our project uses a mix of java, javafx and css to create a
spam filter. The code the trains itself to determine what emails 
are spam and what emails are ham. We then use test files which are 
already determined to be spam and ham and find out how accurate our
code is in determining whether something is spam or ham.
